# IWish
A simple wish list that can list items and pictures, October 2017


 After studying java, I made a simple wish list application which can save its name, brand, cost, a picture and a short memo.
If you copy a url of product detail and paste it into the memo section, the url text is converted into an active link of the url.

Also if you swipe the main page to the right, youâ€™ll see a tap game I made just for fun.
