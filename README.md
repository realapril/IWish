# IWish
A simple wish list that can list items and pictures, October 2017


While studying java, I made a simple wish list application which can save its name, brand, cost, a picture and a short memo.
If you copy a url of product detail and paste it into the memo section, the url text is converted into an active link of the url.

After making this application I decided to stuy php and server since saving images without server was so difficult,
and I wanted to store datas somewhere safe, rather than the smartphone itself with shared preferences.

Also if you swipe the main page to the right, youâ€™ll see a tap game I made just for fun.
